This plugin is designed to parse your router's webpage to display your daily and monthly data usage.
It requires a file called "network.config"

network.config should hold the following settings:
ip = <ip of router, normally 192.168.1.1>
user = <router's user name>
password = <routers password>

This is designed for netgear routers and has only been tested on the wndr4000
